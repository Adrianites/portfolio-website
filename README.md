# 🚗 **Portfolio Racer** 🚗

Welcome to **Portfolio Racer** – my portfolio website in the form of a mini-driving game! Instead of scrolling through boring pages, drive around a fun map and discover my projects, skills, and more. **Buckle up and enjoy the ride!** 🚙💨

## 📜 **About the Project**
Ever thought portfolios should be a little more… *interactive*? Me too! In **Portfolio Racer**, you get to drive a virtual vehicle around a 2D world that represents my skills, projects, and experience. **No more static portfolios – get ready to explore as you go!**

### **Features**
- **Drive Around Freely**: Use WASD to cruise through my portfolio – no grid, just smooth driving fun!
- **Explore Key Areas**: Each stop on the map reveals different sections of my portfolio (like **"About Me," "Projects," "Skills,"**).
- **Interactive Pop-Ups**: Stop at points of interest to get information about me, my work, and my skills.

## 🕹 **How to Play**
1. **Drive**: Use the **WASD** to control your vehicle.
2. **Explore**: Move around the map to find different portfolio sections.
3. **Discover**: Stop at each section for pop-ups with my work, skills, and details.
4. **Enjoy the Journey!**
